##### A project for learning an aspect of developing a Polymer app, deployed on Firebase hosting.

The idea is to prove out an approach or component in the simplest project first, before combining it with other code in a real project.

# \<poly-on-fire-social-logins\>

## What it does:

Polymer project with federated logins via firebase auth, and Twitter, Facebook, and Google OAuth

# Notes to be fleshed out later:

* works on twitter yada only proof is on youtube
* here is youtube link
* all code taken from polycast .... and polymerfire.auth/demo?
*  email/password login - demo code doesn't work, only including here in case someone wants to send me a pull request with code that they have already tested as working
* motive1: why re-invent the wheel when the big well financed guys have already done it?
* motive2: if I was a user would I rather trust new site or facebook/twitter/google
* motive3: easily explainable to general public
